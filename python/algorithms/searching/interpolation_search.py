    """
    Perform an interpolation search on the given sorted list to find the target element.

    Args:
        arr (List[Any]): The sorted list to search through.
        target (Any): The element to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The index of the target element if found, otherwise -1.

    Time Complexity:
        Best Case: O(1) - When the target is at the estimated position.
        Average Case: O(log log n) - When the target is somewhere in the list.
        Worst Case: O(n) - When the target is uniformly distributed and not present.

    Space Complexity: O(1) - Only a constant amount of extra space is used.
