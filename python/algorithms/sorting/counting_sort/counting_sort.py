Counting Sort Algorithm Implementation
Author: Bjorn Melin
Date: 1/28/2025

Counting Sort is an integer sorting algorithm that operates by counting the 
number of objects that have distinct key values (kind of hashing). It is not 
a comparison-based sorting algorithm and its time complexity is O(n + k), 
where n is the number of elements in the input array and k is the range of 
the input.

Time Complexity:
- Best Case: O(n + k)
- Average Case: O(n + k)
- Worst Case: O(n + k)

Space Complexity: O(n + k)
