## Conclusion

The benchmark results clearly show that advanced sorting algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Tim Sort significantly outperform simpler algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort, especially on larger datasets. Tim Sort, which is Python’s built-in sorting algorithm, consistently performs the best across all dataset sizes.

These results highlight the importance of choosing the right sorting algorithm based on the dataset size and the specific requirements of the application.
