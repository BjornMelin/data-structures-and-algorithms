## Data Collection Notes

1. Timing Methodology

   - System.nanoTime() for measurements
   - Individual operation timing
   - Aggregate operation totals
   - Controlled environment

2. Data Size Considerations

   - Fixed initial size
   - Consistent operation counts
   - Scaled search/remove operations

3. Quality Controls

   - Background process minimization
   - Consistent memory conditions
   - Multiple run verification
   - Outlier identification

4. Environmental Factors
   - JVM warm-up effects noted
   - Memory management impact
   - System load monitoring
   - Temperature stability

## Performance Patterns

1. Initial Operations

   - Consistent startup overhead
   - Predictable warm-up period
   - Stable operation timing

2. Bulk Operations

   - Linear scaling observed
   - Memory impact visible
   - Collection-specific patterns

3. Final Operations
   - Consistent performance
   - Minimal degradation
   - Expected variance ranges

## Data Validation

1. Consistency Checks

   - Operation completion verification
   - Result validation
   - Time measurement accuracy
   - Environmental stability

2. Error Handling

   - Exception monitoring
   - Operation retry tracking
   - Failure rate analysis
   - Recovery patterns

3. Statistical Validity
   - Standard deviation analysis
   - Outlier identification
   - Trend verification
   - Confidence intervals
