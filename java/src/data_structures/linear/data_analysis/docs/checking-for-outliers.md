# Performance Variability Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes performance outliers and variations observed across multiple test runs of data structure operations. Understanding these variations is crucial for reliable performance predictions and implementation choices.

## Methodology

- 10 complete test runs
- Identical test conditions
- All background processes minimized
- Consistent hardware environment
- Standard deviation analysis for outlier detection

## Significant Variations

### ArrayList

- Addition: 77,478,812ns outlier in first run (2x typical)
- Search: 16,289,020,210ns spike in run 6 (+50% vs average)
- Sort: 161,038,274ns and 220,660,522ns notably below mean
- Total time variance: ~15% across runs

### Vector

- Addition: 84,126,692ns maximum (2x minimum)
- Search: Consistent except 16,289,745,018ns outlier
- Remove: 1,233,791,078ns minimum (40% below maximum)
- Sort: 199,480,340ns maximum (46% above mean)

### HashTable

- Remove: High variability (887,491ns to 2,576,540ns)
- Sort: 457,052,087ns maximum (2x mean)
- Otherwise stable performance profile

### HashSet

- Addition: 295,869,708ns maximum (50% above mean)
- Search: 12,396,870ns spike (2x typical)
- Sort: Consistent except 138,063,426ns outlier

### HashMap

- First run significantly higher across operations
- Search: Initial run 15% above subsequent averages
- Sort: 109,761,383ns maximum (2x mean)
- Total time stabilized after first run

### LinkedHashSet

- Addition: 343,637,348ns maximum (40% above mean)
- Remove: First run 3x typical performance
- Sort: 165,647,489ns outlier (3x mean)
- Generally stable except noted spikes

### LinkedList

- Addition: 79,139,043ns spike (3x mean)
- Remove: 2,889,700,442ns minimum (40% below typical)
- Sort: 396,202,606ns maximum (2x mean)
- Consistent baseline with occasional spikes

### TreeSet

- Removal: Notable variance (1,462,019ns to 6,589,871ns)
- Sort: Widest performance spread (37,327,005ns to 89,682,364ns)
- Search: Most consistent operation

### TreeMap

- Addition: 617,892,528ns maximum (80% above mean)
- Remove: 4,449,811ns spike (3x typical)
- Sort: 184,699,650ns maximum (2x mean)
- Total time varies up to 20%

## Analysis

### Patterns in Variability

1. Initial run often shows higher times
2. Sort operations show highest variance
3. Search operations most consistent
4. Remove operations show structure-specific patterns

### Likely Causes

1. JVM warm-up effects
2. Memory management overhead
3. Random number generator influence
4. Background system activity
5. Data structure-specific balancing operations

### Stability Rankings

Most Stable Operations:

1. HashSet search
2. TreeSet search
3. ArrayList add
4. Vector search
5. LinkedHashSet remove

Most Variable Operations:

1. HashMap search
2. TreeMap sort
3. LinkedList remove
4. HashTable remove
5. Vector sort

## Recommendations

1. Implementation Choices

- Consider variation ranges for critical operations
- Account for worst-case scenarios
- Plan for performance spikes

2. Testing Methodology

- Discard first run results
- Use multiple run averages
- Monitor system environment
- Account for JVM warm-up

3. Performance Requirements

- Include variance in specifications
- Plan for performance ranges
- Consider operation stability needs

4. Structure Selection

- Match stability needs to usage patterns
- Consider performance predictability
- Account for outlier impact

## Conclusions

1. Performance variations are structure-specific
2. Operation type influences stability
3. Implementation affects predictability
4. Environment impacts variability
5. Testing methodology crucial for accuracy

Understanding these variations is essential for reliable system design and appropriate data structure selection.
