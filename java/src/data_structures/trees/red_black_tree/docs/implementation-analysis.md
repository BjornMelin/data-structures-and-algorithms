# Red-Black Tree Implementation Analysis

## Introduction

This document analyzes a Java implementation of a Red-Black Tree data structure, focusing on verifying that the height remains O(lg n) under both average and worst-case scenarios. The implementation includes a complete Red-Black Tree class with all standard operations and a test driver to verify performance characteristics.

## Implementation Methodology

### Red-Black Tree Class

- Implemented all standard Red-Black Tree operations
- Complete functionality ensures valid test results
- Operations include insertion, deletion, rotations, and tree traversal
- Maintains Red-Black Tree properties throughout all operations

### Testing Framework

Two main test methods were implemented:

1. `randomTester` - Tests average-case performance with random insertions
2. `worstCaseTester` - Tests worst-case performance with ordered insertions

#### Test Parameters

- Number of test runs: 10
- Node counts tested: 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, and 1,000,000
- Value ranges: 0-1,000,000 (random case) and 0-(n-1) (worst case)

## Performance Results

### Average Case Results (Random Integer Values)

| Nodes Inserted | Value Range | Max Expected Height | Actual Height | Ratio (Actual/Expected) |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1,000          | 0-1,000,000 | 21.932              | 12.000        | 0.547                   |
| 10,000         | 0-1,000,000 | 28.575              | 16.300        | 0.570                   |
| 100,000        | 0-1,000,000 | 35.219              | 20.100        | 0.571                   |
| 1,000,000      | 0-1,000,000 | 41.863              | 24.400        | 0.583                   |

### Worst Case Results (Sequential Insertion)

| Nodes Inserted | Value Range | Max Expected Height | Actual Height | Ratio (Actual/Expected) |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1,000          | 0-999       | 21.932              | 17.000        | 0.775                   |
| 10,000         | 0-9,999     | 28.575              | 24.000        | 0.840                   |
| 100,000        | 0-99,999    | 35.219              | 31.000        | 0.880                   |
| 1,000,000      | 0-999,999   | 41.863              | 37.000        | 0.884                   |

## Analysis

### Height Verification

- Maximum allowable height: 2lg(n + 1)
- Both scenarios maintained height < maximum allowable height
- Ratio < 1.0 confirms O(lg n) height maintenance

### Performance Characteristics

1. **Average Case**

   - Ratios consistently around 0.5-0.6
   - Actual height approximately half of maximum allowable height
   - Even distribution leads to better balance

2. **Worst Case**
   - Ratios between 0.75-0.9
   - Higher but still within O(lg n) bounds
   - Alternating red-black pattern on rightmost path
   - Rotations prevent exceeding maximum height

### Key Observations

- Worst case heights approximately 30% higher than average case
- Both scenarios maintain logarithmic height bounds
- Tree rebalancing effectively prevents degeneration
- Implementation successfully maintains Red-Black Tree properties

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully maintains O(lg n) height bounds in both average and worst-case scenarios:

1. All test cases showed height â‰¤ 2(lg n + 1)
2. Actual heights were consistently below theoretical maximum
3. Even worst-case sequential insertions maintained logarithmic height
4. Implementation effectively preserves Red-Black Tree properties

This analysis confirms that the Red-Black Tree implementation provides guaranteed O(lg n) performance for basic operations, regardless of insertion order or distribution of values.
